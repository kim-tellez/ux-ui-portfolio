                <p>By early August, I had implemented the style guide and finalized the copy for the site and was ready to hand-off the style guide, an organized digital library of images, and high-fidelity wireframes to the developer. Leading up to the August 26th deadline, I partnered with the developer to create the responsive company website by having check-ins throughout the development stage to answer questions and ensure that the design was implemented as intended. Below youâ€™ll find cropped images of the final designs for both web and mobile.</p>
