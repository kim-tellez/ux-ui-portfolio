                    <li><b>Research and data can be a designer's strongest ally when communicating with stakeholders.</b> When I first joined the team, the founder was driven by her passion to create a safe digital space for children. She envisioned the team working to build a product similar to Hulu, and had already hired a developer to get started on that task. The research I conducted helped to redirect and focus our workstream to create a unique brand, company, and product.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>Picking a process is just a means to an end, but when there is a tight budget and timeline, sticking to the process makes all the difference.</b> Early on, the founder communicated that she needed to have an MVP mobile app prototype before the fall, as she had a list of incubators and accelerator programs that she was preparing to apply for and wanted to have artifacts ready to use during pitches. Having a process to keep the team focused and moving forward meant that we could pivot, re-prioritize, and communicate changes early on to ensure we met the August 26th deadline.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>A product designer wears many hats.</b> This rings particularly true for my experience with this start-up, where at times I was project manager, meeting facilitator, brand developer, illustrator, all while also doing UX/UI work.</li>
