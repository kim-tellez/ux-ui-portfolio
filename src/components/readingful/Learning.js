                <p>Throughout this project, I was able to practice the full scope of the design thinking process. My learnings were both granular in that each step had its challenges and learnings, and broad as I reflect on the overall process.</p>
                <p>Here are three of the major learnings that I'm walking away with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The design thinking process is messy, iterative, and effective.</b> While I designed for this project, I had the privilege of taking my time with each of the design thinking steps. However, I found myself also doing shorter sprints of define-ideate-prototype-test throughout the process, as my first idea was never my best idea (or even a good idea). I learned to trust the process and not get discouraged by my growth areas because I saw improvement through each iteration.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>Feedback is fodder for a designer's growth.</b> As a UX/UI Design Fellow through Springboard, I had a dedicated mentor and constant access to on-demand mentor calls with Sr. Designers. Throughout my designing process, I would often seek feedback from Sr. Designers to make sure that I was on the right track. Without their feedback, my learning would have been 100x slower. (Thank you!)</li><br/>
                    <li><b>Being a remote design team of 1 has its challenges and opportunities.</b> In addition to 'classic' UX work like interviews, testing, and visual design, I was also challenged with recruiting potential users, coordinating meetings, and troubleshooting any unexpected issues that came up during remote usability tests. I also had the opportunity to deeply get to know and understand my users, own the full scope of the design, and even think at the systems level when making decisions about the product and brand.</li>
